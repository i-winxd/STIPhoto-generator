# STIPhoto-generator
Quickly create Survive the Internet photo images

## How do I use this??
1. Run the program.
2. Choose the folder the exe/python file prompts you to. This program will then gather all the PNG/JPG files in that folder. If there are too many image files, this program sorts images alphebatically. NOTE: Only RGB and RGBA images are supported. If any image isn't RGB/RGBA, it will be skipped.
4. In the same directory of the exe/python file, it will create a new folder called ``export`` and create a bunch of image files compatible with survive the internet.
STI has around 130-135 images (I don't remember which one). Drag all the images in ``export`` to ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Jackbox Party Pack 4\games\SurviveTheInternet\content\STIPhoto``.
